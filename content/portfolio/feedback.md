title: Toward Consilience in The Use of Task-Level Feedback to Promote Learning 
---

A literature review and theoretical framework for understanding how people learn from feedback. Three main findings are situated within their respective theoretical accounts and then integrated: feedback messages should convey information about correctness, highlight the correct answer, and provide additional context for why the answer is correct; errors made with higher confidence are more likely to be corrected (the "hypercorrection effect""), and the finding that delayed feedback produces better long-term learning than immediate feedback.
