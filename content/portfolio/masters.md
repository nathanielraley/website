title: Learning Analytics in Large College Classrooms
---

Recently, a large undergraduate course at the University of Texas has implemented a new class structure that replaces high-stakes tests with daily quizzes administered during class via computer. I propose an algorithmic innovation to optimize content delivery to improve learning outcomes. Given graded student quiz data from one semester of this course, I use multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) and sparse factor analysis (SPARFA) to jointly estimate concepts underlying the items and each studentsâ€™ mastery of these concepts, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach in real-world example. After comparing these factor-analytic methods, I also explore free-response and student chat data using basic natural language processing methods. Techniques from learning analytics can help realize the full potential of spaced retrieval practice in the classroom by optimizing the selection of repeated items so as to target remediation. Furthermore, such techniques can be used to introduce variability into retrieval practice, encouraging a deeper understanding of the content which is more likely to transfer to novel problems.
