title: Estimating the Causal Effect of Retrieval Practice on Future Course Performance
---

This research builds directly upon my descriptive analysis (see below) by combining the syllabus dataset with student records to assess how prerequisite-course features affect student performance in their subsequent courses. Specifically, introductory courses high and low in retrieval-practice requirements were compared in terms of their students subsequent success using inverse propensity-score weighted logistic regressions with cluster-robust standard errors to improve causal inference. Results showed that additional retrieval practice improved studentsâ€™ performance in their subsequent courses. However, the average treatment effect estimates were small and somewhat sensitive to variations in model. Finally, subsequent-course performance was regressed on the full set of educational relevant variables using lasso regularization, identifying a set of instructional variables related to retrieval practice and spacing (including number of quizzes and cumulative exams) as important correlates of student success.
