\hypertarget{research}{\section*{Research Statement}}
{\small  I am a 3\textsuperscript{rd}-year graduate student and researcher who loves learning about learning, wherever it can be found and at every level of experimental analysis: \emph{in situ, in vivo, in vitro,} and \emph{in silico}. I am dedicated to making the process of learning as powerful and efficient as possible % at all levels of education
through psychological, biological, and technological cross-pollination. I want to collaborate with educators to generate and evaluate hypotheses about how students learn worldwide; I believe that in addition to improving the quality and availability of education, an enduring \emph{love of learning} should be the aim of every educator and the prerogative of every child. Further, I feel that urgent effort is needed to optimize student learning---increasing the efficacy of education will generate advancements \emph{at present unfathomable} in the total amount of knowledge and truth in the world. Still more powerful pedagogies will result, fueling a feedback loop that will push our species onward and upward over critical thresholds in discovery. Only an optimally educated humanity will be equipped to solve today's most pressing problems and to safeguard a future for our posterity % can solve the problems that now distress us and answer the questions that now stymie us. } 
(\hyperlink{tutor}{See teaching/tutoring statement below}).

\hypertarget{tutor}{\section*{Teaching Statement}}
{\small I am an applied learning researcher, teacher, and tutor possessed of a passion for education and extremely keen to share this passion with others. I have 3+ years of experience tutoring students 1-on-1 across a wide range of subjects and grade levels and I have been a substitute high school teacher in two different Texas ISDs. The majority of my teaching background is in exam preparation; my interest in testing and tutoring took hold in high school, where I was a successful member of the Academic Decathlon team---the kids who ``take tests for fun."  Dedication to this program taught me effective study strategies and  led me to develop quite a knack for standardized testing. But more importantly, the program instilled in me \emph{a love for learning itself...} to be compelled by curiosity, to feel the rapture of realization, the awe of finally ``getting it". Crucially, it gave me to understand the ``if-then" contingencies between effort and goal-attainment, empowering me for the first time to take active control of my own learning.  Now, an all-consuming desire to know is the polestar of my life and I am fully equipped to follow its lead; as an aspiring educational psychologist, I know that this \emph{love of learning} and knowledge-autonomy are the most valuable gifts I've ever received and I feel duty-bound to kindle in others this selfsame spark. To me, nothing could be more worthwhile--no good greater nor pursuit higher--than stewardship of the burgeoning intellect. Teaching brings me boundless joy---getting through to students, charting their progress, tailoring instruction to fit their needs, helping them achieve their goals... but above all else, helping to inspire in all a life-long love of learning.}
